## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed
- Basic understanding of object-oriented design principles

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ood-application.git
   ```


3. Build and start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Configuration

You need to configure some settings for the application. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following environment variables:

```env
DATABASE_NAME=oddoDs
EMAIL=test@gmail.com
PASSWORD=test-test
LANGUAGE=English
MASTER_PASSWORD=hvwr-dq2n-dden
```

These environment variables will be used by the Docker containers to configure the application.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can access it as follows:

1. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified in `docker-compose.yml`).

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the application.
